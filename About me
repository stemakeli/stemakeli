- 👋 Hi, I’m @stemakeli, call me Steve
- 👀 I’m interested in website building from scratch, using html,css,js,ect. I also enjoy art and indoor cycling on my spin bike.
I'm intersted in the spiritual side of life, living close to nature and to be self sufficient.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css. I'm working on my blogging site "Justindoorcycling" which is aimed at bringing like minded poeple who ride
spin/exerrcise bikes to youtube at home together. Also i'm working on my main website building site "Zegweb" designe.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on both my sites with any ideas that anyone has to improve the look.
